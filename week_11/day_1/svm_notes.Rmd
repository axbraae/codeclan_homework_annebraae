# Support Vector Machine

## What is it?

Kicking about since 1990, the support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised multidimensional model for classification and regression.

It separates different classes with a boundary line (hyperplane) that maximizes the distance (margin) between two groups.

Using non-linear kernels it can also work to classify non-linear data.

## How does it work?

Let's look at a simple linear SVM algorithm.

First, the support vectors are selected. In the below, the two groups to be separated are shown in red and black.

The support vectors are the closest data points for each group which maximizes the distance between the other groups



## Why use SVM?

* handwriting recognition
* face detection
* email classification
* gene classification

It is useful for finding complex relationships between the data without the need for transforming the data. Good at handling small complex data.


## Pros

- one of the best classifiers for use in multiple settings with minimal optimisation
- runs well on complex data with multiple predictors or where there are more predictors than data points (i.e. multidimensional data)
- uses support vectors which makes the algorithm memory efficient
- able to use custom kernels to deal with non-linear data

## Cons

- prone to overfitting where there are more predictors than data points
- supervised therefore requires training with labelled data
- requires data which can be separated by a linear boundary
- no probability estimates but can use k-fold cross validation
- better with smaller data sets as it has a high training time
