# Question 1

Tidy up the data ready for regression:

    * You might like to think about removing some or all of `date`, `id`, `sqft_living15`, `sqft_lot15` and `zipcode` (`lat` and `long` provide a better measure of location in any event).
    * Have a think about how to treat `waterfront`. Should we convert its type?
    * We converted `yr_renovated` into a `renovated` logical variable, indicating whether the property had ever been renovated. You may wish to do the same.
    * Have a think about how to treat `condition` and `grade`? Are they interval or categorical ordinal data types?
    
```{r}
kc_house <- read_csv("data/kc_house_data.csv")

head(kc_house)

#check missing
kc_house %>% 
  summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.x))))

#number of distinct values in each variable
kc_house %>% 
  summarise(across(everything(), ~ n_distinct(.x)))

#convert categorical variables to numeric/factor
kc_house_tidy <- kc_house %>% 
  mutate(waterfront = as.logical(waterfront),
         renovated = ifelse(yr_renovated != 0, TRUE, FALSE),
         condition = recode_factor(condition,
                                   "1" = "A",
                                   "2" = "B",
                                   "3" = "C",
                                   "4" = "D",
                                   "5" = "E"),
         view = recode_factor(view,
                              "0" = "Z",
                              "1"= "A",
                              "2" = "B",
                              "3" = "C",
                              "4" = "D"),
         grade = case_when(
           grade >= 11 ~ "high",
           grade > 7 ~ "above average",
           grade == 7 ~ "average",
           grade > 3 ~ "below average",
           grade <=3 ~ "fail"
         )) %>% 
    select(-c("date", "id", "sqft_living15", "sqft_lot15", "zipcode", "yr_renovated"))
```

`condition` - convert to factor and relabel 1:5 as A:E
`grade` - bin grade into 5 categories, high, above average, average, below average, fail

# Question 2

Check for aliased variables using the `alias()` function (this takes in a formula object and a data set). [**Hint** - formula `price ~ .` says 'price varying with all predictors', this is a suitable input to `alias()`]. Remove variables that lead to an alias. Check the 'Elements of multiple regression' lesson for a dropdown containing further information on finding aliased variables in a dataset.


```{r}
alias(lm(price ~ ., data = kc_house_tidy))
```
looks like I can drop sqft_basement

```{r}
kc_house_tidy <- kc_house_tidy %>% 
  select(-sqft_basement)

#check
alias(lm(price ~ ., data = kc_house_tidy))
```

# Question 3

Systematically build a regression model containing up to **four** main effects (remember, a main effect is just a single predictor with coefficient), testing the regression diagnostics as you go
    * splitting datasets into numeric and non-numeric columns might help `ggpairs()` run in manageable time, although you will need to add either a `price` or `resid` column to the non-numeric dataframe in order to see its correlations with the non-numeric predictors.


1. Have a look at correlated variables.
Numeric:
```{r}
kc_house_tidy %>% 
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>% 
  ggpairs()
```

I had to blow this up but it looks like for the numeric variables, `sqft_living`, `sqft_above` and `bath` show the highest correlation with price.

```{r}
kc_house_tidy %>% 
  select(where(~!is.numeric(.x)), price) %>% 
  ggpairs()
```

For the categorical variables, it looks like `waterfront`, `grade` and `condition` have the highest variability when it comes to `price`.


Build a first model with `sqft_living` as the explanatory variable (x) and `price` as the outcome variable (y)

```{r}
model_1a <- lm(price ~ sqft_living, data = kc_house_tidy)

summary(model_1a)
autoplot(model_1a)
```

The residuals do not fulfil the diagnostic criteria! The residuals are not normal at extremes of the distribution and the scale location indicates the residuals are heteroscedastic.

The model currently only explains 49% of the variance in house price. I will have a look at the residuals and see if I can improve the model.


```{r}
kc_house_remaining_resid <- kc_house_tidy %>% 
  add_residuals(model_1a) %>% 
  select(-c("price", "sqft_living"))

kc_house_remaining_resid %>% 
  select(where(~!is.numeric(.x)), resid) %>% 
  ggpairs()
```

```{r}
kc_house_remaining_resid %>% 
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>% 
  ggpairs()
```

waterfront looks interesting from the box plots of the non-numeric and latitude looks interesting from the numeric data.

Let's try both and see how the model looks

```{r}

model_2a <- lm(price ~ sqft_living + waterfront, data = kc_house_tidy)

summary(model_2a)
autoplot(model_2a)

```

```{r}
model_2b <- lm(price ~ sqft_living + lat, data = kc_house_tidy)

summary(model_2b)
autoplot(model_2b)
```

model_2b explains more of the variance (higher multiple R-squared of 56%). Both models do not have brilliant residual diagnostics however. It is difficult to pick one to move forward with. The residuals are still heteroscedastic. I will take model_2b forwards and check the residuals for the next best explanatory variable.

```{r}
kc_house_remaining_resid <- kc_house_tidy %>% 
  add_residuals(model_2b) %>% 
  select(-c("price", "sqft_living", "lat"))

kc_house_remaining_resid %>% 
  select(where(~!is.numeric(.x)), resid) %>% 
  ggpairs()

```

```{r}
kc_house_remaining_resid %>% 
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>% 
  ggpairs()
```

Looking at the correlations of the residuals, view is the next highest correlated (at 0.303), while waterfront again looks promising in the categorical. I will focus on view for the next model.

```{r}

model_3a <- lm(price ~ sqft_living + lat + view, data = kc_house_tidy)

summary(model_3a)
autoplot(model_3a)

```

The model now explains 60% of the variation in house price. However, the residual diagnostics show a trend in the residuals variances which are still heteroscedastic.

Let's move forward anyway and have a look at which variable might explain the next most variance in our model.

```{r}
kc_house_remaining_resid <- kc_house_tidy %>% 
  add_residuals(model_3a) %>% 
  select(-c("price", "sqft_living", "lat", "view"))

kc_house_remaining_resid %>% 
  select(where(~!is.numeric(.x)), resid) %>% 
  ggpairs()
```




```{r}
kc_house_remaining_resid %>% 
  select(where(is.numeric), resid) %>% 
  ggpairs()
```

Waterfront and year build (yr_built) look like good bets for me. I will add these to the model and select the best.

```{r}
model_4a <- lm(price ~ sqft_living + lat + view + waterfront, data = kc_house_tidy)

summary(model_4a)
autoplot(model_4a)
```

```{r}
model_4b <- lm(price ~ sqft_living + lat + view + yr_built, data = kc_house_tidy)

summary(model_4b)
autoplot(model_4b)
```

The addition of waterfront to the model explains more of the variation in price than the addition of year built. Therefore I will move forward with model_4a.

Both models show similar diagnostics of the residuals, which are fulfilling most criteria but which show some heteroscedaticity.


To check this is a better model than model_3a I will do an `anova()`.

```{r}
anova(model_4a, model_3a)
```

There is a statistically significant difference when adding `waterfront` to the model.

# Extensions

* Consider possible interactions between your four main effect predictors and test their effect upon $r^2$. Choose your best candidate interaction and visualise its effect. 

possible interactions:
sqft_living:lat
sqft_living:view
sqft_living:waterfront
lat:view
lat:waterfront
view:waterfront

```{r}
kc_house_remaining_resid <- kc_house_tidy %>% 
  add_residuals(model_4a) %>% 
  select(c("sqft_living", "lat", "view", "waterfront", "resid"))

coplot(resid ~ sqft_living | lat, 
         panel = function(x, y, ...){
         points(x,y)
         abline(lm(y~x), col = "blue")
       },
       data = kc_house_remaining_resid)
```

```{r}
kc_house_remaining_resid <- kc_house_tidy %>% 
  add_residuals(model_4a) %>% 
  select(c("sqft_living", "lat", "view", "waterfront", "resid"))

coplot(resid ~ sqft_living | view, 
         panel = function(x, y, ...){
         points(x,y)
         abline(lm(y~x), col = "blue")
       },
       data = kc_house_remaining_resid)
```
```{r}
kc_house_remaining_resid <- kc_house_tidy %>% 
  add_residuals(model_4a) %>% 
  select(c("sqft_living", "lat", "view", "waterfront", "resid"))

coplot(resid ~ sqft_living | waterfront, 
         panel = function(x, y, ...){
         points(x,y)
         abline(lm(y~x), col = "blue")
       },
       data = kc_house_remaining_resid)
```
```{r}
coplot(resid ~ lat | view, 
         panel = function(x, y, ...){
         points(x,y)
         abline(lm(y~x), col = "blue")
       },
       data = kc_house_remaining_resid)
```
```{r}
coplot(resid ~ lat | waterfront, 
         panel = function(x, y, ...){
         points(x,y)
         abline(lm(y~x), col = "blue")
       },
       data = kc_house_remaining_resid)
```

```{r}
coplot(resid ~ view | waterfront, 
         panel = function(x, y, ...){
         points(x,y)
         abline(lm(y~x), col = "blue")
       },
       data = kc_house_remaining_resid)
```


From the interaction coplots looks like waterfront does not have a good interaction variable.

sqft_living:lat
sqft_living:view
sqft_living:waterfront
lat:view
lat:waterfront
view:waterfront
```{r}
model_5a <- lm(price ~ sqft_living + lat + view + waterfront + sqft_living:lat, data = kc_house_tidy)

summary(model_5a)
autoplot(model_5a)
```


```{r}
model_5b <- lm(price ~ sqft_living + lat + view + waterfront + sqft_living:view, data = kc_house_tidy)

summary(model_5b)
autoplot(model_5b)
```


```{r}
model_5c <- lm(price ~ sqft_living + lat + view + waterfront +sqft_living:waterfront, data = kc_house_tidy)

summary(model_5c)
autoplot(model_5c)
```


```{r}
model_5d <- lm(price ~ sqft_living + lat + view + waterfront + lat:view, data = kc_house_tidy)

summary(model_5d)
autoplot(model_5d)
```


```{r}
model_5e <- lm(price ~ sqft_living + lat + view + waterfront + lat:waterfront, data = kc_house_tidy)

summary(model_5e)
autoplot(model_5e)
```


```{r}
model_5f <- lm(price ~ sqft_living + lat + view + waterfront + view:waterfront, data = kc_house_tidy)

summary(model_5f)
autoplot(model_5f)


```


Two models have very similar multiple R-squared scores:
model_5b and model_5c.

Check with an anova? 

```{r}
anova(model_5b, model_5c)
```
They are both as good as each other!

* Calculate the relative importance of predictors from your best $4$-predictor model (i.e. the model without an interaction). Which predictor affects `price` most strongly?

```{r}
library(relaimpo)
calc.relimp(model_4a, type = "lmg", rela = TRUE)
```
From the relative importance, square foot of livig space is the most important predictor with a lmg of 0.66.
