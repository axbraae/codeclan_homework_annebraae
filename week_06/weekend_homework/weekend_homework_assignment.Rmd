## Hypothesis testing - practical

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(infer)

data(msleep)
```

<br>

**Question 1.**  
Explore the dataset and familiarise yourself with it.

```{r}
glimpse(msleep)
head(msleep)

dim(msleep)
```
There are 83 rows of 11 variables. Variables appear to have been classed correctly.
The names look clean, there are some missing values. Let's have a look at these now.

```{r}
msleep %>% 
  summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.x))))
```
There are 7 missing values in vore, 29 in conservation, 22 in sleep_rem, 51 in sleep_cycle and 27 in brainwt. Leave these in the dataset for now.

<br>

**Question 2.**  
Jabberwockies sleep for around 7 hours a night, on average. Perform an appropriate statistical test to determine whether the mean `sleep_total` in the sampled population of animal types differs from the typical value for jabberwockies.

This is a one sample mean test
- H0: µ(sleep_total) = 7
- HA: µ(sleep_total) != 7
alpha: 0.05

The null hypothesis is that the mean of animal types sleep total is no different to that of the mean jabberwockies sleep time, that is 7 hours. The alternative hypothesis is that the mean sleep total of the animal types is different to that of jabberwockies.

First we need to calculate the sample mean:

```{r}
mean_sleep <- msleep %>% 
  summarise(mean_sleep = mean(sleep_total))
```

Next I will calculate the null distribution which calculates the mean for the bootstrap sample and repeats this many times to generate the null distribution. The center of this distribution is then shifted to the given value to be tested which in this case is 7.

We treat the situation specified by the null hypothesis as being true and use this mean to generate a sampling distribution using bootstrapping.

```{r}
#generate null distribution based on mean value specified in null hypothesis
null_distribution <- msleep %>% 
  specify(response = sleep_total) %>% 
  hypothesise(null = "point", mu = 7) %>% 
  generate(reps = 10000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean")

#visualise
null_distribution %>% 
  visualise(bins = 30) + 
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = mean_sleep, direction = "both")
```
```{r}
p_value <- null_distribution %>% 
  get_p_value(obs_stat = mean_sleep$mean_sleep, direction = "both")

p_value
```
The p-value is less than 0.05 (alpha) therefore we can reject the null hypothesis (H0) in favor of the alternative hypothesis (HA). There is enough evidence in the sample to suggest that the mean `total_sleep` of all animal types in the data is statistically significantly different from the mean total sleep of jabberwockies of 7 hours.

<br>

**Question 3.**  
Perform an appropriate statistical test to determine whether omnivores sleep for significantly longer than herbivores, on average.

This is an independent two sample mean test.

I will test this at an alpha of 0.05.

The hypotheses are:

- H0: µ(omnivores) - µ(herbivores) = 0
- HA: µ(omnivores) - µ(herbivores) > 0

Calculate the sample mean (observed statistic) for omnivores and herbivores:
```{r}
observed_stat <- msleep %>% 
  filter(!is.na(vore),
         !vore %in% c("carni", "insecti")) %>% 
  specify(sleep_total ~ vore) %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("omni", "herbi"))
```

Calculate the null distribution
```{r}
null_distribution <- msleep %>% 
  filter(!is.na(vore),
         !vore %in% c("carni", "insecti")) %>% 
  specify(sleep_total ~ vore) %>%  
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  generate(reps = 10000, type = "permute") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("omni", "herbi"))

null_distribution %>% 
  visualise() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = observed_stat, direction = "right")

p_value <- null_distribution %>% 
  get_p_value(obs_stat = observed_stat, direction = "right")

p_value
```

The p-value of 0.1272 is greater than 0.05 which means we lack sufficient evidence to reject H0 therefore we fail to reject H0. Based on our sample we do not have enough evidence to suggest that the mean total sleep time of omnivores is statistically significantly larger than the mean total sleep time of herbivores. Therefore we have no evidence that omnivores sleep longer than herbivores.

<br>

**Question 4. **
Perform an appropriate statistical test to determine whether the proportion of domesticated animal types in the population of animal types is greater than $5\%$.

This is a one sample proportion hypothesis test.

alpha 0.05

- H0: π(domesticated animal types) = 5%
- HA: π(domesticated animal types) > 5%

Let's wrangle the data to get an `is_domesticated` column and then calculate the observed proportion statistic in the sample data.
```{r}
domesticated <- msleep %>% 
  filter(!is.na(conservation)) %>% 
  mutate(is_domesticated = if_else(conservation == "domesticated", TRUE, FALSE)) %>% 
  select(name, is_domesticated)

#generate observed_statistic
observed_stat <- domesticated %>% 
  specify(response = is_domesticated, success = as.character(TRUE)) %>% 
  calculate(stat = "prop") %>% 
  pull()

observed_stat
```

The proportion of domesticated animals observed in the sample is 18.5%. Let's see if this is significantly greater than 5%.

```{r}
#generate null distribution
null_distribution <- domesticated %>% 
  specify(response = is_domesticated, success = as.character(TRUE)) %>% 
  hypothesise(null = "point", p = 0.05) %>% 
  generate(reps = 10000, type = "simulate") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "prop")

#visualise the distribution
null_distribution %>% 
  visualise() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = observed_stat, direction = "right")

p_value <- null_distribution %>% 
  get_p_value(obs_stat = observed_stat, direction = "right")

p_value
```

The p-value of 6e-04 is less than the alpha of 0.05. There is enough evidence in the sample data to reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis. That is that the proportion of domesticated animal types in the population of animal types is statistically significantly greater than 5%.

## Hypothesis testing - Defining the Hypothesis 

For the following three business problems write out:

* What kind of test you would use  
*  $H_0$ and $H_a$ in **both** mathematical notation and in words. 
* Also state the method you would use to generate the null distribution (bootstrap, permutation or simulation). 

<br>

**Question 1.**

This is a one sample proportion hypothesis test.

- I would set an alpha of $0.05$

- My hypotheses are:
    -$H_0$ π(people who know of the coffee shop) = 40%
  The null hypothesis is that 40% of the town population know of the coffee shop.
  
    -$H_a$ π(people who know of the coffee shop) \> 40%
  The alternative hypothesis is that more than 40% of the town population know about the coffee shop.
  
- the null distribution would be generated with a simulation.

<br>

**Question 2.**  
You work for a website design company and have performed an **A/B test** on the position of a banner on a website promoting a particular item. 
<br>
You selected five days at random last month and then randomly selected $200$ of each sampled day's users into group $A$ and another $200$ of that day's users into group $B$. Group $A$ continued to be shown the banner at the right hand side of the webpage (its usual position) while group $B$ was shown the banner at the top of the page. You monitored each sampled user's interactions with the website, in particular the 'click through rate' (CTR) on the banner, i.e. what proportion of sampled users clicked on the banner. You want to use the sampled data to test the hypothesis that website users overall are more likely to click on the banner if positioned at the top of the page   
<br>

**Question 3.**  
You work as an analyst for a car manufacturing company - they have specific standards they must meet for standards and regulation purposes. You have been asked to check the quality control of the manufacture of a particular car part. You have been given data on a sample of $200$ parts produced over the period of a week (the sampled parts were pulled at random from the production line and measured: the factory produced a lot more than $200$ parts that week). The specification of the part stipulates a width of $145\textrm{mm}$, and the manufacturing process is said to have 'drifted' if the mean width of parts differs significantly from $145\textrm{mm}$. You want to use the sampled measurements to test whether the process overall has drifted.

<br>

**Question 2.**  

**Website company problem**. Significance level: 0.01, $p$-value: 0.006

<br>

**Question 3.**  

**Manufacturing company problem**. Significance level: 0.05, $p$-value: 0.55

## Market Basket Analysis

**Association rule mining** is regularly used by retailers to find associations between products that people purchase, perhaps for an online retailer, the items that people put together in their 'baskets', and in a bricks and mortar retailer, the items purchased together in a single transaction. The aim is to find recurring patterns in the transactions which the retailer can then use to do targeted marketing of items, seeking to increase 'cross sales'. Rules mining of this sort can also be used in other industries beyond retail to identify patterns in data. 

**Market basket analysis (MBA)** uses association rule mining. It looks at the association of items occurring in a **single basket**, and so won't look at your purchases over time, but only items that are purchased together in a single purchase (i.e. a 'basket'). As a good example, you may have seen the 'Frequently Bought Together' section on Amazon (and other sites), which looks at items you've got in your basket and suggests items that other people commonly have in their baskets when they also have these items:

```{r, echo=FALSE,, out.width = '60%', fig.align="center" }
knitr::include_graphics("images/freq_bought_together.jpeg")
```

MBA differs from recommendation algorithms because the association rules look only at items bought together in a single purchase, they don't use any characteristics of the purchaser to profile them (e.g. 'Based on purchases by people like you, you may also like...') or how their purchases vary over time. The association rules used for MBA use the probability principles we learned on Monday this week. 

## Association rules 

The rules obtained by MBA have three concepts associated with them, as follows:

**Support**  
The probability of items in the rule being purchased together:

e.g. $\textrm{sup}(A \rightarrow B) = P(\textrm{A and B being purchased together}) = \frac{\textrm{number of transactions involving A and B}}{\textrm{total number of transactions}}$

Support also has meaning for single items:

e.g. $\textrm{sup}(A) = P(A) = \frac{\textrm{number of transactions involving A}}{\textrm{total number of transactions}}$

**Confidence**  
The proportion of purchases of $A$ where $B$ has also been purchased:

e.g. $\textrm{conf}(A \rightarrow B) = \frac{\textrm{P(A and B being purchased together)}}{\textrm{P(A being purchased)}}$

**Lift**  
Increase in sales of $A$ when sold with $B$

$\textrm{lift}(A \rightarrow B) = \frac{\textrm{sup}(A \rightarrow B)}{\textrm{sup}(A) \times \textrm{sup}(B)}$

If $\textrm{sup}(A \rightarrow B) = \textrm{sup}(A) \times \textrm{sup}(B)$ then this means $P(A \textrm{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B)$. We know from the probability lesson earlier in the week that this means the purchase of $A$ and $B$ are independent events. This may help with our interpretation of lift values:

* $\textrm{lift}(A \rightarrow B) \gt 1$ - items $A$ and $B$ are more likely to be bought together 
* $\textrm{lift}(A \rightarrow B) = 1$ - no correlation between items $A$ and $B$ being bought together
* $\textrm{lift}(A \rightarrow B) < 1$ - items $A$ and $B$ are unlikely to be bought together

A and B don't need to be single items, they could be sets of items (itemsets) e.g. A = {TV, DVD player}, B = {TV stand}. 

## Using the rules 

Once we have calculated the rules we can use them to gain insights about items/itemsets. 

For example, if for items $A$ and $B$ the corresponding rule $(A \rightarrow B)$ has a low support but a lift greater than $1$ then we can say that when $A$ is purchased $B$ is often purchased with it (high lift), but such transactions don't happen all that frequently (low support). 

The **apriori algorithm** is often used as a way of selecting 'interesting' rules. It will calculate all the support, confidence and lift values for the item/itemset combinations of your dataset and will return those with support values greater than a pre-defined threshold value set by the user. 

## Homework exercise

Let's load in some transaction data which has details on the items purchased in each transaction (where each transaction is uniquely identified by the `InvoiceNo` variable). 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
transactions <- read_csv("data/online_retail_subset.csv")
head(transactions, 20)
```

## Association rules 

For the first section we are interested in the purchase of two particular items:

* item $A$ - 'HEART OF WICKER SMALL' (`StockCode` $22469$) 
* item $B$ - 'LARGE CAKE TOWEL PINK SPOTS' (`StockCode` $21110$)

**Question 1.**  
Calculate the support for item $A$ (this will be the support for a single item)

**Question 2.**  
Calculate the support and confidence for rule $(A \rightarrow B)$. 

**Question 3.**  
Calculate the lift for $(A \rightarrow B)$

<details>
<summary>**Hint**</summary>
You will need to calculate the support for $B$]
</details>

## Apriori algorithm 

Read up on the `arules` and `arulesViz` packages, which make use of the 'apriori' algorithm http://www.salemmarafi.com/code/market-basket-analysis-with-r/comment-page-1/

Use these packages to play around, applying the apriori algorithm to the `transactions` dataset we have. 

To use the `arules` package we need the data to be a special type of 'transactions' object. We do this by reading in the data using `read.transactions()` function from the `arules` package. We have done this for you below (for more information on this type of transactions object see the helpfile `?transactions`):

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(arules)
library(arulesViz)
```

```{r}
transactions_reformat <- transactions %>%
  select(InvoiceNo, Description) %>%
  na.omit()

write_csv(transactions_reformat, "transactions_reformat.csv")

apriori_format <- read.transactions("transactions_reformat.csv", format = "single", sep = ",", header = TRUE, cols = c("InvoiceNo", "Description"))

inspect(head(apriori_format))
```

Now you're all set to play around with `arules` and `arulesViz`. 

**Warning about run time/memory usage:** if the minimum support is set too low for the dataset, then the algorithm will try to create an extremely large set of itemsets/rules. This will result in very long run times and the process may eventually run out of memory. You can either start by trying a reasonably high support (for this dataset, we would suggest starting at $1%$ and then systematically lower the support if don't see any results). There is also an argument `maxtime` which can be used to prevent long run times (more information on that in the `apriori` user document [here](https://rdrr.io/cran/arules/man/apriori.html)).
