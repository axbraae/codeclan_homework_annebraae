This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
book <- read_csv("data/books.csv")
```
initial thoughts

How many different authors are there? Are there some publishing houses with more authors than others?
What is the language split between the authors/publishing houses?
  How many languages are there?
Link between page numbers and rating?

Notice NAs and two slipped rows. Need to think of a way to spot this and clean it up.
